The rapid development of visual neuromorphic hardware can be attributed to their ability to capture, store and process optical signals from the environment. The main limitation of existing visual neuromorphic hardware is that the realization of complex functions is premised on the increase of manufacturing cost, hardware volume and energy consumption. In this study, we demonstrated an optical synaptic device based on a three-terminal van der Waals (vdW) heterojunction that can realize the sensing functions of light wavelength and intensity as well as short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity. In the image recognition task, we constructed an optical reservoir neural network (ORNN) and a visible light communication system (VLC) composed of this optical synaptic device. The ORNN has a recognition rate of up to 84.9% for 50 000 color images in 10 categories in the CIFAR-10 color image dataset, and the VLC system can achieve high-speed transmission with an ultra-low power consumption of only 0.4 nW. This work shows that through reasonable design, vdW heterojunction structures have great application potential in low-power multifunctional fusion application tasks such as visual bionics.
