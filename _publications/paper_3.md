Sorting is a fundamental task in modern computing systems. Hardware sorters are typically based on the von Neumann architecture, and their performance is limited by the data transfer bandwidth and CMOS memory. Sort-in-memory using memristors could help overcome these limitations, but current systems still rely on comparison operations so that sorting performance remains limited. Here we describe a fast and reconfigurable sort-in-memory system that uses digit reads of one-transistor–one-resistor memristor arrays. We develop digit-read tree node skipping, which supports various data quantities and data types. We extend this approach with the multi-bank, bit-slice and multi-level strategies for cross-array tree node skipping. We experimentally show that our comparison-free sort-in-memory system can improve throughput by 7.70x, energy efficiency by 160.4x and area efficiency by 32.46x compared with conventional sorting systems. To illustrate the potential of the approach to solve practical sorting tasks, as well as its compatibility with other compute-in-memory schemes, we apply it to Dijkstra’s shortest path search and neural network inference with in situ pruning.
