This course is an elective open to students of all majors, designed for those eager to learn in-depth about intelligent hardware architecture design. The course will focus on fundamental knowledge in areas such as digital integrated circuit design, chip architecture design, and hardware-software co-acceleration. Additionally, this course aims to develop students' basic engineering practice skills, including hardware implementation of simple algorithms, system simulation, and hardware debugging. Students will design and develop simple intelligent computing function modules independently and ultimately build a complete prototype to validate the chip architecture. They will gain a preliminary understanding of various design methods for intelligent hardware architecture and acquire basic skills in hardware-software co-optimization, as well as broaden their academic perspective. This will lay a solid foundation for further theoretical studies and research practice.
