One paper, featuring memristor-enabled memory-centric instruction-set architecture (MeMCISA) aiming to efficiently accelerate versatile workloads in modern database systems, is accepted by MICRO 2024 as regular paper. MeMCISA performance is evaluated with standalone database queries as well as complex database workloads from representative benchmarks including UniBench, neural collaborative filtering (NCF), and ResNet-18. Simulation results demonstrate that MeMCISA achieves up to 41.84x âˆ¼ 1767.70x in speed compared to general-purpose processors (CPUs/GPUs).
