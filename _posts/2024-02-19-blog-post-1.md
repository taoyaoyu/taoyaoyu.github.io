One paper, featuring VO2 memristor-based frequency converter with in-situ synthesize and mix for wireless internet-of-things, is accepted by Nature Communications. Wireless internet-of-things (WIoT) with data acquisition sensors are evolving rapidly and the demand for transmission efficiency is growing rapidly. Frequency converter that synthesizes signals at different frequencies and mixes them with sensor datastreams is a key component for efficient wireless transmission. However, existing frequency converters employ separate synthesize and mix circuits with complex digital and analog circuits using complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices, naturally incurring excessive latency and energy consumption. Here we report a highly uniform and calibratable VO2 memristor oscillator, based on which we build memristor-based frequency converter using 8x8 VO2 array that can realize in-situ frequency synthesize and mix with help of compact periphery circuits.
