One paper, featuring A Heterogeneous System-in-Package Integrating FPGA and DSP Chiplets for Versatile Workload Acceleration, is accepted by IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits (JSSC). Integrating heterogeneous chiplets in a package presents a promising and cost-effective approach to constructing scalable and flexible systems for accelerating a wide range of workloads. We introduce Arvon that integrates a 14-nm FPGA chiplet with two efficient and densely packed 22-nm DSP chiplets using embedded multidie interconnect bridges (EMIBs). The chiplets are interconnected via a 1.536-Tb/s advanced interface bus (AIB) 1.0 interface and a 7.68-Tb/s AIB 2.0 interface. Arvon is programmable, supporting various workloads from neural network (NN) to communication signal processing.
