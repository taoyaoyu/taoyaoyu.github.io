Dr. Yaoyu Tao research projects include the design of several Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) chips, Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) chips (world-first development of a DNC on-chip network architecture, with performance metrics reaching internationally leading levels at the time), and other related technologies. Based on prior research, further exploration was conducted on kernel implementation suing compute-in-memory solutions based on post-Moore novel memristor devices (e.g. sort-in-memory), multi-kernel integrated compute-in-memory cores, compute-in-memory tensor instruction sets and compiler, and compute-in-memory system on chips (SoC). Additionally, new circuit designs were developed to address the non-ideal characteristics of post-Moore devices (such as non-binary error correction circuits). Relevant work have published in top international journals and conferences, including Nature Electronics, JSSC, MICRO/HPCA/VLSI, FPGA, IEDM, Advanced Functional Materials, Advanced Electronic Materials, and other papers. Furthermore, this research has led to several Chinese patents and has been applied in products through collaborations with industry companies.
